National Education (NE) is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and boost students' confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.

The National Education messages and accompanying values are:

*   **Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.**  
    We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life.
    
*   **We must preserve racial and religious harmony.**  
    We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people.
    
*   **We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility.**  
    We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort.
    
*   **No one owes Singapore a living.**  
    We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity.
    
*   **We must ourselves defend Singapore.**  
    We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being.
    
*   **We have confidence in our future.**United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation.
    

  

**OUR CURRICULUM**

Our NCHS-NE programme aims to prepare our NCzens for an increasingly complex world and develop them into concerned citizens who will actively contribute to Singapore by anchoring them with sound values and a shared Singapore Spirit. The NCHS-NE curriculum will be a 4 year journey for all NCzens and upon completion, our students should have the following: 

*   **A sense of belonging:** To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation. 
    
*   **A sense of reality:** To be aware of the contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world. 
    
*   **A sense of hope:** To have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead. 
    
*   **The will to act:** To show willingness to play a role in the future of Singapore
