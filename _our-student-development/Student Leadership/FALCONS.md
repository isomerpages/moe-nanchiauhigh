**Testimonies**

FALCONS was a programme that had the greatest impact on me and my leadership journey. The opportunities were endless, ranging from an amazing hiking trip to Hong Kong, as well as chances to be at the helm of school events like CCA Bazaar and Secondary 3 camp. Not only did I enjoy myself immensely, I got to learn from and overcome all sorts of challenges I faced, both physically and mentally. I think that this program was unforgettable because it was a place where I could try new things I used to shy away from and grow alongside other leaders. The values and skills I learnt are things I remember and apply in my life to this day.

FALCONS was one of the best opportunities in NCHS for me to grow and mature as a person. It presented a chance for me to learn insightful skills, develop my leadership ability and apply them as well. There were countless hikes, workshops and trips where I practiced what I learnt. Of course, the hallmark of the programme was an overseas trip to Hong Kong, where we hiked and camped for 3 days and 2 nights. This seemed daunting at the beginning of the programme, but towards the end, I saw every single member, experience growth like never before. Joining FALCONS also opened up new opportunities, which allowed me the chance to represent Singapore in APYLC, where NCHS’s group of delegates flew to Indonesia to take part in various discussions and activities which tackled socio-political issues with students from various countries such as Japan and New Zealand. All in all, FALCONS opened up opportunities I never thought possible and is a programme which you can’t find in any other secondary school.
