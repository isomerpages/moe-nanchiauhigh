<p><strong>Events &amp; Initiatives</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) Youth For Causes (YFC) Project</strong>
<br>The Service-Learning Champions are selected in Secondary Two, where they
embark on the Youth For Causes project under the guidance of Service-Learning
teacher mentors and their seniors. Through this programme, they develop
the capacity to plan and implement self-initiated service-learning projects
that raise awareness, mobilise resources, and organise direct service activities
in support of social service agencies of their choice. In Secondary Three,
the Champions apply their learning by leading their classmates in the Youth
For Causes project.

<p><strong>(ii) Design Thinking Workshop</strong>
<br>The Secondary Two and Three Service-Learning Champions participated in
a series of design thinking workshops, where they were introduced to the
application of design thinking principles in the planning and development
of their service-learning projects. To further enrich their learning experience,
NCHS alumni were invited to share their insights on effective time management,
balancing academic commitments, and their involvement in the Youth For
Causes project during their time in school. Additionally, the current Secondary
Four Service-Learning Champions facilitated a segment aimed at equipping
their juniors with practical knowledge on proposal writing for service-learning
initiatives. Following the workshops, the students embarked on a Service-Learning
Journey to Dialogue in the Dark, where they gained valuable perspectives
on empathy and inclusion by experiencing everyday situations in complete
darkness, guided by a visually impaired facilitator.
