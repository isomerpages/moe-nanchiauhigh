**<u>Testimonies</u>**

The FALCONS camp provided numerous opportunities and activities that not only challenged our leadership skills but also fostered our ability to respond effectively as team leaders. These activities encompassed kayaking, a 12km hike, and beach challenges, all of which greatly enhanced our communication skills, fostering collaboration among leaders from various CCAs and the broader leadership group. As we took our first steps into leadership roles, this experience proved invaluable in shaping us into more confident and capable leaders, instilling in us a profound understanding of what makes good leadership. It encouraged us to develop our own personalised leadership styles, a principle that every FALCONS embraced. As participants in the FALCONS Leadership Development Programme, exposure to diverse leadership approaches and the practice of teamwork prepared me well for the upcoming projects within the Student Council. This experience significantly influenced my approach when leading different subcommittees, as I had already cultivated my unique leadership style. When planning the annual Secondary One Orientation Camp, the skills and connections I forged in FALCONS enabled us to collaborate effectively across various leadership groups and delegate responsibilities with precision.

In retrospect, my involvement in FALCONS profoundly expanded my understanding of leadership, honed my leadership skills, and enriched my experience, significantly enhancing my readiness for future leadership roles.

The FALCONS Leadership Development Programme gave me a safe but practical space to carry out the 5 leadership practices that we were taught over the course of workshops held by the different FALCONS teachers. Their unique but personal leadership experiences and learnings inspired me and the chance to apply what I learnt came during the 2022 FALCONS camp where I was pushed out of my comfort zone during the various challenges that I faced with my groupmates. For example, there was a 12km hike at Kent Ridge Park and the 80 of us had to work together to complete our goals. We had to reach our destination in a stipulated amount of time, on top of carrying our heavy bags, dealing with different setbacks thrown at us along the way, walking under the hot sun, as well as the pressure of our instructors and teachers. It was definitely not an easy feat, but this experience allowed us to take turns guiding our group and ensure that everyone was well taken care of and that no one was left behind. 这个露营仿佛代表了我们在将来的一年在领导的路程会面对的困难与挫折，但它也让我成为了一个不同的领导者。它使我改变了我对待身边学生领袖的方法。我开始更注重每个人的意见，在准备节目的时候也不会只顾虑到需要完成的工作，而是要更关心学生领袖的状态与面对的担忧。起初刚升上学生理事会副主席的我，对于如何带领一团人感到非常忐忑与压力。但是，这个节目教导了我如何处理不同的问题，相信经过这个节目的其他领袖者也会这么同意。虽然我在这个节目只呆了一年，但是我学到的东西会跟我一辈子，绝对是我在南侨里忘不了的一个时段。

The FALCONS Leadership Development Programme was an incredibly enriching experience for me as it allowed me to have valuable interactions with other leaders from various school groups. We were able to gain more insight on one another’s ideas and leadership styles, which enabled us to become better leaders as well. The FALCONS programme also opened up global opportunities for me through the Asia-Pacific Young Leaders Convention (APYLC), which was hosted virtually by Suzhou Science &amp; Technology Town Foreign Language School in 2022. We discussed socio-political issues with student delegates from China, Indonesia, Korea, Japan and Australia. Despite it being held via Zoom, we learned embroidery and Tai Chi from our counterparts. There was also a virtual school tour held by the different schools and it was interesting to see the various programmes offered in each countries’ schools. I had the opportunity to put my bilingual skills to the test by translating the task brief to the Taiwanese delegates in mandarin. It was a very memorable experience seeing everyone from various backgrounds come together from all parts of the world to discuss topics we all have in common. APYLC has given me new found appreciation for the diversity in our world as well as the different perspectives that stem from it. FALCONS has pushed me beyond my comfort zone to reach greater heights as a leader.

Participating in the FALCONS Leadership Development Programme has been a transformative journey, elevating both my personal and leadership growth to new heights. FALCONS not only refined my leadership skills but also nurtured my self-awareness and confidence through planning and execution of major school events like exploRACE 2023. Navigating through challenges with resilience and poise became second nature, significantly contributing to my overall development. I was able to collaborate with peers and learned to leverage and complement each other's strengths, seamlessly turning challenges into opportunities and celebrating shared victories. Whether it was positively influencing peers or steering projects to success, the FALCONS Leadership Development Programme empowered me to make a tangible difference. It's truly fulfilling to witness the impact extending beyond myself, contributing to the growth and vibrancy of our school. The reflective nature of FALCONS programme also provided insights into my leadership style, strengths, and areas for improvement. Serving as a catalyst for personal growth, FALCONS has ignited a passion for leadership that undoubtedly shapes my future endeavours.

The FALCONS Leadership Development Programme made it clear to me the distinction between an administrator and a leader. It provided a clear definition of effective leadership and empowered me to develop my own leadership style, one that I am undeniably confident in. After participating in multiple FALCONS training sessions, I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively lead a team and foster a harmonious environment within any organisation I lead. However, possessing theoretical knowledge on leadership is only one aspect; the true measure of a leader lies in the ability to translate that knowledge into action. Guided by our teacher mentors, we honed our leadership styles to not only reflect our own personalities but also align with the unique needs of different types of organisations. Personally, leading the sports leaders and the track team demanded slightly different leadership styles, given that the former is a leadership organisation, and the latter is a sports team. For instance, leading the track team called for a more light-hearted approach, while the sports leaders required a more assertive stance. The most valuable lesson I gleaned from this program is that being a flexible and adaptable leader entails considering the needs and preferences of every team member, ensuring their inclusion and comfort, while also preparing the team for potential challenges — using each obstacle as a stepping stone towards collective success. The FALCONS programme has greatly enriched my leadership abilities and has also played an instrumental role in cultivating lasting relationships. I firmly believe that it will continue to benefit me in my lifelong journey.

FALCONS was a programme that had the greatest impact on me and my leadership journey. The opportunities were endless, ranging from an amazing hiking trip to Hong Kong, as well as chances to be at the helm of school events like CCA Bazaar and Secondary 3 camp. Not only did I enjoy myself immensely, I got to learn from and overcome all sorts of challenges I faced, both physically and mentally. I think that this program was unforgettable because it was a place where I could try new things I used to shy away from and grow alongside other leaders. The values and skills I learnt are things I remember and apply in my life to this day.

FALCONS was one of the best opportunities in NCHS for me to grow and mature as a person. It presented a chance for me to learn insightful skills, develop my leadership ability and apply them as well. There were countless hikes, workshops and trips where I practiced what I learnt. Of course, the hallmark of the programme was an overseas trip to Hong Kong, where we hiked and camped for 3 days and 2 nights. This seemed daunting at the beginning of the programme, but towards the end, I saw every single member, experience growth like never before. Joining FALCONS also opened up new opportunities, which allowed me the chance to represent Singapore in APYLC, where NCHS’s group of delegates flew to Indonesia to take part in various discussions and activities which tackled socio-political issues with students from various countries such as Japan and New Zealand. All in all, FALCONS opened up opportunities I never thought possible and is a programme which you can’t find in any other secondary school.
