**Leadership and Training Opportunities**


We believe in empowering our students through a wide variety of platforms.  

The Student Councillors have multiple leadership opportunities such as organising and supporting formal school events such as Secondary One Orientation Camp, Student Leaders’ Investiture, Teachers’ Day and Open House. On top of the various school events which the councillors take part in, they are also actively involved in their department effort to plan and reach out to their school mates (and teachers) to uplift the learning environment and emotional wellbeing.

To prepare them for the role, the student councillors will have the following training opportunities:
