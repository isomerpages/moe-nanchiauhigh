**Our Aim**


We aim to provide leadership platforms for students to:  

1.  Ignite passion to serve others
    
2.  Acquire values that will guide their decisions in life.
    
3.  Develop leadership skills
    
4.  Foster deeper civic engagement through active involvement in community service
    

**Events & Initiatives**


**(i) Youth for Causes Project**

The Service-Learning Champions are recruited in Secondary Two and will embark on the Youth for Causes programme under the mentorship of the Service-Learning teacher mentors as well as their seniors. Under this programme, they will learn to plan and execute self-initiated service-learning projects to raise awareness, funds and organise direct service events for social service agencies of their choice. The service-learning leaders also undergo design thinking workshops to learn how to apply the design thinking approach in their service-learning projects.
