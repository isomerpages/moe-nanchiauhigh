4.  Develop leadership skills<br>

**Events &amp; Initiatives**<br>

**(i) Youth For Causes (YFC) Project**<br>
The Service-Learning Champions are recruited in Secondary Two and will embark on the Youth For Causes project under the mentorship of the Service-Learning teacher mentors as well as their seniors. Under this programme, they will learn to plan and execute self-initiated service-learning projects to raise awareness, funds and organise direct service events for social service agencies of their choice. In Secondary Three, the Service-Learning Champions will apply what they have learnt previously, and lead in their class Youth-For-Causes project.<br>

**(ii) Design Thinking Workshop**<br>
The Secondary 2 and 3 Service-Learning Champions also undergo design thinking workshops to learn how to apply the design thinking approach in their service-learning projects. We have also invited two of the alumni members to share more about the service-learning experiences during their schooling days, and how to manage their time and workload. In addition, one of the segments was organized by the current Secondary 4 Service-Learning Champions, which also taught the service-learning leaders on tips on proposal writing for their service-learning projects.<br>
