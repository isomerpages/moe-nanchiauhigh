**Our Aim**


We aim to provide leadership platforms for students to:  

1.  Ignite passion to serve others
    
2.  Acquire values that will guide their decisions in life.
    
3.  Develop leadership skills
    
4.  Foster deeper civic engagement through active involvement in community service
    

**Events & Initiatives**


**(i) Youth for Causes Project**

The Service-Learning Champions are recruited in Secondary Two and will embark on the Youth for Causes programme under the mentorship of the Service-Learning teacher mentors as well as their seniors. Under this programme, they will learn to plan and execute self-initiated service-learning projects to raise awareness, funds and organise direct service events for social service agencies of their choice. The service-learning leaders also undergo design thinking workshops to learn how to apply the design thinking approach in their service-learning projects.

**(ii) Shines-in-Harmony**Â 

Shines-in-Harmony is organised annually to provide a platform for students to raise funds and awareness for beneficiaries. The Service-Learning Champions lead in the planning for NChasTalent performance to provide an opportunity to showcase their talent and to express their appreciation and gratitude. Furthermore, the student leaders also lead in the lucky draw segment to encourage the school population to donate pre-loved items as well as to encourage them to donate for the beneficiaries.
