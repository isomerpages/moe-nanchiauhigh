**CCE Department Vision**<br>
Caring Leaders with Values and Character
<br>

**CCE Department Mission**<br>
To develop NCzens to be confident and empathetic leaders with Power of Positivity to realize their fullest potentials and to serve the nation.


NCHS recognises the importance of developing the character of our pupils; particularly so in a rapidly changing and uncertain world driven by globalization and technological advancements. Guided by our school vision, mission and values, NCHS CCE curriculum aims to inculcate NCzens with good values and social â€“emotional competencies necessary for not just facing these challenges but also seizing opportunities brought about by these forces.&nbsp;

NCzens will undergo a variety of programmes such as learning journeys and National Education commemorative events. These programmes seek to not only inculcate in NCzens a sense of pride in our national identity but also improve their understanding of how they can contribute towards the sustained development of Singapore. This will empower our students to develop into responsible, morally upright citizens who contribute actively to a cohesive and inclusive society.
