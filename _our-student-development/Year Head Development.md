The Year Head department provides a horizontal integration of both the academic curriculum and student development curriculum in each of the levels to ensure the students' holistic development. The Year Head team builds a culture of care by advocating for students’ needs and overall well-being.

The Year Head department also oversees the various initiatives as part of our Power Of Positivity culture. Below are examples of such activities:

**‘Cream of the Crop’ (in conjunction with Sec. 4 Graduation Day)**

A new initiative this year to bring the 4 levels of students closer to one another, the Sec. 1-3 students were invited to join their graduating seniors in their Sec. 4 Graduation Day. Aside from clapping and cheering for their seniors, all students were also treated to ice-cream which they thoroughly enjoyed while mingling with one another.
