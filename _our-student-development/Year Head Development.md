The Year Head department provides a horizontal integration of both the academic curriculum and student development curriculum in each of the levels to ensure the students' holistic development. The Year Head team builds a culture of care by advocating for students’ needs and overall well-being.

The Year Head department also oversees the various initiatives as part of our Power Of Positivity culture. Below are examples of such activities:

**‘Cream of the Crop’ (in conjunction with Sec. 4 Graduation Day)**

A new initiative this year to bring the 4 levels of students closer to one another, the Sec. 1-3 students were invited to join their graduating seniors in their Sec. 4 Graduation Day. Aside from clapping and cheering for their seniors, all students were also treated to ice-cream which they thoroughly enjoyed while mingling with one another.

**A Kind Exchange - Friendship Day**

The school celebrates the beginning of the year by having a bowl of Tau Huey with Glutinous Rice balls together. Leveraging on Valentine's Day, the school uses this day to celebrate and appreciate friendship and camaraderie among students, teachers, non-teaching staff and school leaders. Both staff and students write gratitude messages for each other.

**Zentangle**

In line with the school’s Positive Education journey, Zentangle, an activity that requires one to be mindfully focussed and engaged (ie. fully present) while drawing patterns and designs of his/her choice, was carried out for all 4 levels of students so that they can sharpen mindfulness skills in order to help them reduce their stress, anxiety and negative emotions.
