number (if provided by applicant during the school choice submission period)
<br><strong>b.</strong> S1 Internet System (S1-IS) (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</a>)

sent via Parents Gateway (PG) to all parents of students posted to our
school. This link will be available <strong>from 9am, S1 Posting Results day</strong>&nbsp;and
will <strong>close at 9am, two calendar days after</strong>.</p>

period will be required to write in to <a href="mailto:nchs@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>nchs@moe.edu.sg</u></a>, indicating your
