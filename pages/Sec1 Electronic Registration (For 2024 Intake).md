**Section D: Purchase of Personal Learning Device**
===================================================
     

In alignment with the vision of the MOE EdTech Masterplan 2030 “Technology-transformed learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed world", our NCHS NDLP creates opportunities and curates experiences for all Sec 1 to 4 NCzens to develop their digital literacy competencies to create, curate and connect information in the digital networked environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable NCzens to develop an understanding of the social practices (tacit norms and skills) governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively.

This is enabled by the provision of a Personal Learning Device (PLD) for every student. The school has chosen iPad as the school prescribed PLD for our Secondary one student. 

Please read this [letter](https://www.nanchiauhigh.moe.edu.sg/files/NCHS%20Letter%20to%20Parents%20for%20PDLP%20Procurement_21%20Dec%202022.pdf) and [Infographic on the NCHS PLD Initiative 2024](https://www.nanchiauhigh.moe.edu.sg/files/Infographic%20on%20the%20PLD%20Initiative_2023%20-%20NCHS%20(Website).pdf) on the important information about the PLD for your child/ward before submitting your option below.

*   For Singapore Citizens, [Click here](https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin) to indicate if you would like to purchase a PLD with the school bulk purchase.
*   For Permanent Residents/International Students, we will send to your email indicated in the e-Registration form the softcopy letter to be printed, signed and passed to your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher by 03 Jan 2024 (Wed).



**Section E: First Day of School**
===================================================
Reporting time is at 7.30am and dismissal for the 1st day of school will be at 2.40pm. No visitors/parents are allowed in school. As the traffic is heavy, we encourage all students to arrive early and report at the school quadrangle, next to the canteen. Our Sec 1 teachers will be there to welcome the students. 

All Sec 1 students are to wear our school uniform (i.e. white shirt/blouse and short pants/skirt with black shoes). However, if you are not able to buy our school uniform on time, you may come in your primary school uniform.

  

Please bring along your writing materials and relevant learning materials, by referring to the timetable, which can be retrieved at
