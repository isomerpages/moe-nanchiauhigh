**Section D: Purchase of Personal Learning Device**
===================================================
At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (“NDLP”) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (“PDLP”) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (“PLD”).

**Section E: First Day of School**
===================================================
Reporting time is at 7.30am and dismissal for the 1st day of school will be at 2.40pm. No visitors/parents are allowed in school. As the traffic is heavy, we encourage all students to arrive early and report at the school quadrangle, next to the canteen. Our Sec 1 teachers will be there to welcome the students. 

All Sec 1 students are to wear our school uniform (i.e. white shirt/blouse and short pants/skirt with black shoes). However, if you are not able to buy our school uniform on time, you may come in your primary school uniform.

  

Please bring along your writing materials and relevant learning materials, by referring to the timetable, which can be retrieved at

**Section F: Sec One Orientation Camp (SOOC)**
