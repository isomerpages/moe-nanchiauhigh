</p>

All parents and students are strongly encouraged to purchase the school
uniform online and arrange for home delivery.</p>
<h1><strong>Section D: Purchase of Personal Learning Device</strong></h1>
<p>In alignment with the vision of the MOE EdTech Masterplan 2030 “Technology-transformed
learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed world", our
NCHS National Digital Literacy Programme creates opportunities and curates
experiences for all Sec 1 to 4 NCzens to develop their digital literacy
competencies to create, curate and connect information in the digital networked
environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable NCzens
to develop an understanding of the social practices (tacit norms and skills)
governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate
and participate productively.</p>
<p>This is enabled by the provision of a Personal Learning Device (PLD) for
every student. The school has chosen iPad as the school prescribed PLD
for our Secondary one student.</p>
<p>Our 2025 Sec1 students will only receive their PLDs in Term 2, 2025.</p>
<p>We will send out more information about this purchase of the PLD with
the school bulk purchase via Parents Gateway (PG) in Term 1, 2025.</p>
<h1><strong>Section E: First Day of School</strong></h1>
<p>Reporting time is at <strong>7.30am</strong> and dismissal for the 1st day
of school (<strong>2 Jan 2025</strong>) will be at <strong>2.00pm</strong>.
No visitors/parents are allowed in school. As the traffic is heavy, we
encourage all students to arrive early and report at the school quadrangle,
next to the canteen. Our Sec 1 teachers will be there to welcome the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Sec 1 students are to wear our school uniform (i.e. white shirt/blouse
and short pants/skirt with black shoes). However, if you are not able to
buy our school uniform on time, you may come in your primary school uniform.</p>
<p>The 2024 timetable will be published on our school website (under 'Resources'
&gt; 'Student's One Stop Portal') no later than Monday, 1st January 2024.
The details of the class allocation will also be sent to your child’s iCON
email address (or the one they indicated during this e-Registration) no
later than Monday, 1st Jan 2024.</p>
<h1><strong>Section F: Sec One Orientation Camp (SOOC)</strong></h1>
<p>From 3 Jan to 5 Jan 2024, Sec 1s will follow a customized orientation
programme instead of the official school timetable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of Sec One Orientation Camp:
<br>1.To immerse into the vibrant NCHS school culture.&nbsp;
<br>2.To establish meaningful relationships with peers, seniors and teachers.
<br>3.To acquire functional knowledge and skills for a smooth transition into
secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
