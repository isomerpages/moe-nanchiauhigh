<p>On behalf of all staff and students, we welcome you and your child to
our Nan Chiau High family!</p>
<p><strong>To prepare the start of your Secondary School journey with us, please look through the information detailed below and assist us with an online registration form to be filled by you/your child.</strong>
</p>
<h1><strong>Section A: Online Registration</strong></h1>
<p>Please complete <a href="https://go.gov.sg/nchs-2025s1reg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this form</a>  <strong><u>by 5p.m. of the day after the day of release of School Posting results in Dec 2024</u></strong>.
<br>(This link will only be active on the day of release of School Posting
results.)</p>
<h1><strong>Section B: Purchase of Textbooks and Stationery for Sec 1</strong></h1>
<p>Please note that our books and stationery are supplied by our school bookshop
vendor, Overseas Associates Pte Ltd. You may place order via the online
platform or make an appointment for walk-in or FAS appointments, at <a href="https://www.oapl.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.oapl.sg/</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>Section C: Purchase of Uniform and PE attire for Sec 1</strong></h1>
<p>Please click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOQC8AndPN0prz9kqL5UhRFyX62WU57_/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HERE</a> for
the details.</p>
<h1><strong>Section D: Purchase of Personal Learning Device</strong></h1>
<p>In alignment with the vision of the MOE EdTech Masterplan 2030 “Technology-transformed
learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed world", our
NCHS National Digital Literacy Programme creates opportunities and curates
experiences for all Sec 1 to 4 NCzens to develop their digital literacy
competencies to create, curate and connect information in the digital networked
environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable NCzens
to develop an understanding of the social practices (tacit norms and skills)
governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate
and participate productively.</p>
<p>This is enabled by the provision of a Personal Learning Device (PLD) for
every student. The school has chosen iPad as the school prescribed PLD
for our Secondary one student.</p>
<p>We will send out more information about this purchase of the PLD with
the school bulk purchase via Parents Gateway (PG) in Term 1, 2025. Do note
that our 2025 Sec1 students will only purchase and receive their PLDs in <strong>Term 2</strong>,
2025.</p>
<h1><strong>Section E: First Day of School</strong></h1>
<p>Reporting time is at <strong>7.30am</strong>. No visitors/parents are allowed
in school. As the traffic is heavy, we encourage all students to arrive
early and report at the school quadrangle, next to the canteen. Our Sec
1 teachers will be there to welcome the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Sec 1 students are to wear our school uniform (i.e. white shirt/blouse
and short pants/skirt with black shoes). However, if you are not able to
buy our school uniform on time, you may come in your primary school uniform.</p>
<p>The 2025 timetable will be published on our school website (under 'Resources'
&gt; 'Student's One Stop Portal') no later than Monday, 1st January 2025.
The details of the class allocation will also be sent to your child’s iCON
email address (or the one they indicated during this e-Registration) no
later than Monday, 1st Jan 2025.</p>
<h1><strong>Section F: Sec One Orientation Camp (SOOC)</strong></h1>
<p>From 8 Jan to 10 Jan 2025, Sec 1s will follow a customized orientation
programme instead of the official school timetable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of Sec One Orientation Camp:
<br>1. To immerse in the vibrant NCHS school culture.&nbsp;
<br>2. To establish meaningful relationships with peers, seniors and teachers.
<br>3. To acquire functional knowledge and skills for a smooth transition
into secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
