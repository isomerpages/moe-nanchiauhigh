<p><strong>2024 GCE O level Results Release</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>On January 10, 2025, over 600 students gathered in the hall for the results
of the 2024 O-Level exams. The event was a moment of celebration as the
school community gathered to recognise the exceptional academic performances
of the students. They had performed admirably, with many securing impressive
results across various subjects.</p>
<p>The overall performance of the cohort was laudable, as the results reflected
the students’ hard work and their ability to overcome the challenges of
a rigorous academic year. Being dedicated to their studies throughout the
year has played a crucial role in their success. The results showed that
the students had met and often exceeded expectations, achieving high marks
that will serve as a strong foundation for their future academic pursuits.</p>
<p>These impressive results were credited to the collaborative effort between
the students, their families, and the teaching staff. The support provided
by parents, who encouraged their children throughout their educational
journey, had been instrumental in helping the students achieve these outcomes.
The unwavering commitment of the teachers, who guided and mentored the
students throughout the year, was also instrumental in spurring the students
to realise their potential.</p>
<p>While academic achievements should be celebrated, it is important to note
that academic excellence is just one aspect of the students' overall development.
The results were seen not only as an indication of the students’ academic
abilities but also as a reflection of their resilience, determination,
and personal growth throughout their years of study.</p>
<p>In addition to celebrating the high-achieving students, the school was
also proud of the progress made by all students, regardless of their results.
The school remains committed to fostering a nurturing environment where
students can continue to thrive academically, emotionally, and personally.
It looks forward to the continued success of its students in the years
to come.</p>

<p>“Like every other student in that hall, I was super nervous about the
release of the O Level results. Even though my friends constantly assured
me that I would score well, I had doubts as to whether or not I had put
enough effort into revision. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my name
on the screen being highlighted by Mdm Ler for good results. Of course,
this would not have been possible without the continuous and undying support
from my teachers who have come a long way with me these past 4 years, and
strived to give us opportunities to excel.”</p>

<p>JEANETTE LIM KANGTING, 4 Sincerity 2024</p>
<p>“As I walked into the hall, I instantly felt an atmosphere of nervousness
and excitement. The uneasiness set in when the statistics started to flash
on the screen, but it was soon replaced by bewilderment when I saw my name
appear on screen for scoring 8 distinctions. When my form teacher handed
me my certificate, I could not believe my eyes… I had to look at the top
of the page to confirm that the certificate really belonged to me. At the
end of the day, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude towards everyone
who has helped me achieve this set of results. I could not have done it
without the support of the dedicated team of teachers who are always there
to provide encouragement.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>SHANNON ZHUANG XUANHUI, 4 Innovation 2024</p>
<p>“In the morning of the results day collection, I wrote in my diary ‘and
if I slipped, JUST CRY IT OUT’. I felt really nervous and doubted if I
had enough to reach my goals. It wasn't until Mdm Ler announced my name
as one of the students who had done well that I finally felt a sense of
relief. I wouldn’t have been able to achieve this without the unwavering
support of my teachers, whose dedication and guidance shaped my learning
journey, and my peers, whose encouragement made every challenge a little
less daunting. This success is as much theirs as it is mine.”</p>

<p>Reflection by KHOR YU HSIEN CHERVY, 4 Integrity (2023)</p>
<p><em>“I felt nervous at first just like any other student would when I was waiting in the hall to receive my results, and I had lots of doubts on whether I would be able to fare well to enter my desired institution. My fears were proved to be unfounded when I saw my name flashed on the projector for scoring 9 distinctions and I could not believe my eyes.</em>
</p>
<p><em>I owed my achievements to Nan Chiau's dedicated team of teachers and learning resources that they have offered to help students achieve their fullest potential.”</em>
