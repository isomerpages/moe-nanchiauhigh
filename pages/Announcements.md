My fears were proved to be unfounded when I saw my name flashed on the projector for scoring 9 distinctions and I could not believe my eyes.</em></p><p><em>I owed my achievements to Nan Chiau's dedicated team of teachers and learning resources that they have offered to help students achieve their fullest potential.”</em></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Announced on 22 Dec 2023</strong></p><p>Dear 2024 Sec1 students and Parents,<br>Welcome to our Nan Chiau High School big family!<br>You would have received yours / your child or ward's classes allocation via Parent Gateway (PG) by 2p.m. today.
