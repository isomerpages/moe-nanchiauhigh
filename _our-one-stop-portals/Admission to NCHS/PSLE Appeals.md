**PROCEDURES**

**General Information**

School admissions are based on merit in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise. Posting decisions are based on objective and transparent measures of academic merit i.e. PSLE scores. Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to these principles, in order to be fair to other admitted students.
  

(\*Note: Students admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme admitted to.)

**Application Period**

The application period is from the&nbsp;**day of release of Secondary 1 Posting results (9a.m. on 21 Dec 2022) and will close at 12p.m. on 27 Dec 2022.**

  

Late or incomplete application will not be considered. Only shortlisted applicants will be informed.

**How to apply?**

Application is to be done strictly via the online application form&nbsp; at [Sec1 Appeal (for 2023 intake)](https://form.gov.sg/637b469241fdcf00125d8cd7).


For your convenience, it is not necessary to submit any hardcopy appeal form personally.

**What Happens Next?**

All applicants will be put on the waiting list. The school’s decision will be made after the vacancies are ascertained following the release of the Secondary 1 posting results and deadline for online appeal application is over. However, based on past years’ experience, the number of places are limited.

  

Shortlisted applicants may be required to sit for entrance tests and/or interview. They will also be required to produce certified true copies of their documents.

  

**Pending the outcome of appeal, all applicants are required to report to the school that they are posted to by the Ministry of Education on Secondary 1 Registration Day.**&nbsp;Nan Chiau High School will assist to facilitate the transfer process if the applicant is eventually successful.

**Outcome of Application**

Successful applicants will be informed by 31 December.

  

The decision of the school’s Admissions Committee is final and the school will not enter into discussion with the applicants regarding its decision.
