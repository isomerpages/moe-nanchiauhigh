All P6 students from our mainstream schools who pass the PSLE (except those who have been successfully allocated a secondary school place via the Direct School Admissions – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise) are allowed to take part in the annual Secondary 1 Posting Exercise.

  

Successful DSA students who are eligible to opt for Third Language and/or Course Option can do so using the S1 Internet System (S1-IS).
