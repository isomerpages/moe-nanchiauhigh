**3) Frequently Ask Questions**


**1\. I note that Nan Chiau High School (NCHS) is a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school. What is a SAP school?** 

SAP schools were established by the government to promote the learning of Chinese language and culture and to preserve the ethos of Chinese-medium schools. As such, we offer an immersive Chinese learning environment where our students in the school read Higher Chinese Language, amongst other programme and activities.

  

**2\. What is the PSLE cut-off point for 2021 Sec 1 cohort and 2022 Indicative PSLE Score?**

It is 244, based on the Sec 1 intake in 2021. The PSLE aggregate range varies from year to year depending on the applicants and availability of places in the school.  For 2022, the Indicative PSLE Score is 4(M) – 11(M). The score are simulated using the 2020 PSLE cohort results and students’ school choice.

**5\. Enhanced Art Programme (EAP)**

EAP is a MOE signature Art Programme offered to students who are interested and talented in Art at upper secondary programme that leads to the GCE O-Level Art. At Upper Secondary, It hones students’ artistic talents by deepening their development in selected art practices.

To bridge the programme, at lower secondary select students who are inclined towards art are given opportunities to attend Art Talent Programme (ATP). They will attend weekly art enrichment activities after school, to expand their horizon and expose them to knowledge and skills beyond the art classrooms. Through the various art activities at Lower Secondary, students develop their interest in art and can continue to pursue art at Upper Secondary through the EAP. 

Students will be offered EAP at Upper Secondary during the Secondary Two Streaming Exercise if they meet the NCHS EAP requirement.
