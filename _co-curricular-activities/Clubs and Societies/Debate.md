**KEY INFORMATION**

**CCA Description**

The Debate team believes in providing opportunities for our members to articulate and share their thoughts and feelings critically with one another. We believe that interest and passion outweigh expertise, and we welcome all students who are looking for a warm and familial environment where they can develop their love for debate, grow into confident speakers, or even just to get to know some of the wittiest students in the school.
