| Infocomm Club members will be provided training through courses in various infocomm and media domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Game Development and Mobile App Development. | Taking learning out of the classroom is important to augment Infocomm Club members’ in-class lessons and will provide exposure to real-world context and applications. There will be activities (such as company visits) for Infocomm club members to have opportunities to deepen their love for media and tech. | Infocomm Club members will be provided with leadership opportunities that will enable them to demonstrate their leadership abilities. They will be trained by IMDA to carry out their roles effectively. | Infocomm Club students will participate in the yearly Singapore Youth Tech Awards.
