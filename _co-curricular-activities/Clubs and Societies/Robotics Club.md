**CCA Objectives**

Code Builders Club aims to ignite students' passion for infocomm technology and robotics by providing ample opportunities to explore emerging technologies and hands-on experience in building and programming miniature robots. Members will deepen their learning, gain industry exposure, and develop essential skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and event organization. Join us to fuel your curiosity and excel in exciting competitions!


**CCA Description**

Members learn to build and program miniature robots using LEGO MINDSTORM and Arduino, with potential candidates receiving intensive training for competitions. Collaborating with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the club provides opportunities in four key areas: Learn, Discover, Lead, and Excel. Members engage in courses on topics like Artificial Intelligence and Game Development, participate in real-world activities, and develop leadership skills through IMDA training. Additionally, students have the chance to participate in national competitions, in which they will gain exposure and interact with like-minded individuals. In Code Builders Club, students will develop their critical, adaptive and inventive thinking as well as improve their communication, collaboration and information skills.
