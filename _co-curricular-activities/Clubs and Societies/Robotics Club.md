**KEY INFORMATION**

**CCA Objectives**

Robotics Club aims to train students who have the passion to excel in building and programming miniature robots to take part in National competitions.

It aims at promoting problem-solving skills, team spirit, leadership skills and event organising skills.

**CCA Description**

Students learn the basics of building and programming miniature robots (EV3) using LEGO MINDSTORM (a very high level language) as well as Arduino programming (SKETCH) under the instructions of a robotics instructor. Students who have the potential to excel will be selected to undergo further intensive training to prepare them to take part in and win zonal or national competitions. Members will also have physical activities to maintain their physical health and fitness and also to break the usual training routine.
