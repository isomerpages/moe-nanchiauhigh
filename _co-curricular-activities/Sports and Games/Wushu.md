**CCA Description**

In Nan Chiau High School, Wushu is considered a “performing sport”, consisting elements that are characteristic to both the sports and performing arts.

Wushu is derived from Chinese martial arts and it teaches “Wu De”（武德）, which is the martial code of conduct. Learners and practitioners of Wushu are expected to display excellence in their moral character and to uphold integrity and moral courage at all times.

  

Wushu improves one’s flexibility, speed, strength, coordination and endurance. It also instils discipline and respect for others and for oneself.

  

Unlike any other contact sport, Wushu is considered relatively safe due to its performance nature.

  

Wushu is gaining popularity nationwide as more parents and students are coming to recognise the benefits that learning Wushu could reap, be in terms of health or character development.

  

Our Team Singapore has also done the nation proud by constantly achieving excellent results in the SEA Games. Wushu is truly an emerging sport to be enjoyed by all Singaporeans, especially the youths.
