The NCC cadet training syllabus includes general military knowledge, as well as adventure training and leadership development. The integration of land, air and sea programmes is emphasised to enable NCC cadets to enjoy activities that encompass the three elements. In addition, to promote the quest for excellence and inculcate the spirit of participation and sportsmanship amongst the cadets, competitions are included as part of the training curriculum. NCC cadets are also engaged in community service, so as to help develop their sense of social responsibility.
