**CCA Description**

Nan Chiau High School Alopex Scouts learn many skills which can be beneficial to our everyday lives. These skills are developed through outdoor activities such as hiking, camping or even during our weekly training sessions. Some skills include outdoor survival skills, exploration and navigation, as well as first aid. We also learn values such as resilience, perseverance, discipline and respect. These skills and values can help us develop to be better, more self-fulfilled, and generally more improved versions of ourselves as individuals, and play a constructive role in society.

**Highlight(s) of Activities**

The Nan Chiau High School Alopex Scouts is a group that strives to master scouting skills while having fun at the same time. Scouts will enjoy outdoor activities and take up roles that will push them to become better individuals. Scouts will first start off with a unit commander to recite the Scout Promise, and will then proceed with other activities, such as First Aid, Outdoor Cooking, Knots And Pioneering, Camping, Exploration And Navigation Hiking, Drill, Outdoor Survival Skills.
