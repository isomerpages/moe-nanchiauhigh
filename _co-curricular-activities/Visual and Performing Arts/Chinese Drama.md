**CCA Description**

Chinese Drama is a CCA that aims at grooming students who are confident and poised on stage and can take on various performing roles ranging from actors, story tellers to masters of ceremonies. Members practice and learn performing skills under the guidance of experienced instructors who often are also mature stage performers themselves.

Members are also selected and trained to take part in various school functions and external competitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging and national competitions such as the Inter-School Group Story Telling Competition. In Chinese Drama, we believe that every individual is talented in their own way.
