**KEY INFORMATION**

**CCA Objectives**

English Drama aims to provide students with opportunities to:

• Develop confidence and demonstrate artistic techniques to express themselves through Drama.<br>
• Explore and be able to empathise with the way people think, feel and communicate.<br>
• Foster friendships and develop collaborative skills while working to achieve common goals.<br>
• Appreciate rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society

**CCA Description**

In English Drama, students will have the opportunity to present and showcase their skills in the art form through school-based or external performances. In addition, senior students will be able to demonstrate their skills to coach the junior students.

  

Through post-performance reflections or responding to a skit, students will exercise critical thinking, reflect on the elements of the performance observed and apply their acquired skilla nd knowledge to improve a short piece to express their thoughts, feelings and ideas.

  

Through props and costume making, students will be able to relate aesthetically and cognitively to the contexts of the art work.

  

Through improvisation and script-writing, students will explore and experiment multiple perspectives, reassess personal attitudes towards the different themes and incorporate feedback and responses from peers and teachers in order to refine a performance.
