<p><strong>Malay Unit</strong>
</p>
<p>Malay (Special Program) – MSP
<br>
<br><strong>1. Collaboration Between St. Joseph’s Institution Junior and Sec 2 MSP Students: Creating Malay E-books for Primary 1 and 2</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nan Chiau High School and St. Joseph’s Institution Junior (SJI Junior)
collaborate yearly for our annual reading programme. Our Sec 2 Malay Special
Programme students create engaging electronic books (e-books) for Primary
1 and 2 students. This exciting project offers a unique twist: Primary
1 and 2 pupils will get to design their own characters, which will be featured
in the e-books. At the end of the year, our Sec 2 MSP students will read
these e-books they created to the primary 1 and 2 pupils and engage them
in activities such as Kahoot quizzes at the end of the session.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Exploring Malay Culture Through the MSP Enrichment Programme</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Malay Special Programme (MSP) Enrichment Programme offers students
a rich and immersive experience, deepening their understanding of Malay
culture and traditions. As part of the programme, students learned to prepare
beloved Malay traditional dishes such as roti jala and kuih keria, gaining
hands-on experience in crafting these popular snacks. They also explored
Malay communal dining practices and etiquette, while discovering the significance
of the nasi ambeng, a symbolic Malay delicacy often shared in communal
settings. Beyond the kitchen, the students delved into Malay performing
arts, learning to play the kompang, a traditional Malay percussion instrument,
and picking up basic zapin dance moves. They also experienced the fun and
competitive nature of traditional Malay games, such as gasing (top spinning)
and guli (marbles).
<br>
<br><strong>3. MSP Students Celebrate Hari Raya Through Performance, Skit, and Cultural Sharing</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the Malay Special Programme (MSP), our students organise a
short yearly experience to celebrate Hari Raya and share its cultural significance
with the school community. This annual event involves a lively performance
and skit showcasing the traditions, customs, and joyous spirit of Hari
Raya, providing students with a deeper understanding of this important
festival.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Celebrating Hari Raya: A Collaborative Effort with the Land Transport Authority and Local Schools</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an exciting collaboration with the Land Transport Authority (LTA),
students from the Malay Special Programme (MSP) have been actively involved
in setting up informative booths at Punggol and Novena MRT stations. The
goal of these booths is to engage commuters through simple games and activities
that educate the public about Hari Raya and its cultural significance.
This unique initiative is not just about raising awareness, but also about
engaging the community in a fun and interactive way. In addition to the
collaboration with LTA, this project is a joint partnership with local
primary schools, including Greendale Primary School and St. Joseph’s Institution
Junior (SJI Junior).</p>
