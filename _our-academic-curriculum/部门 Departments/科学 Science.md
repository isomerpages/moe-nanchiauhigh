<p><strong>Our Goals</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture the student as an inquirer when s/he is curious about and want
to explore the things around her/him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow students to have joyful learning in science and value science as
an important tool in helping them to explore their natural and physical
world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate scientific literacy in students where they are equipped with
skills to use scientific knowledge to understand and make decisions about
the natural world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</em>
</p>
<p>Lower Secondary ALP is a platform which provides real-life applications
learning. In sec 1, students are taught Arduino Coding &amp; Electronics,
3D-printing &amp; 3D pens, and Design Thinking. They are to understand
and apply the Design Thinking Protocols throughout the whole duration of
the programme. In Sec 2 next year, the students will embark on projects
by applying Design thinking protocols and what they have learnt this year.</p>
<p>In Sec 2, students will advance their ALP learning in the field of Emerging
Technologies. It is an extension of the Sec 1 ALP, students will use the
protocols of Design Thinking to work on projects or solve problems based
on one of the Emerging Technologies themes.</p>
<p><em>Science Talent Programme</em>
</p>
<p>The students are encouraged to participate in the Olympiads in the different
disciplines, i.e. Biology, Chemistry and Physics. The annual Olympiads
encourage the study and appreciation of science beyond the school curriculum
by providing opportunities for student to solve novel questions that require
critical and inventive thinking. These platforms are very useful for students
to challenge themselves in the scientific knowledge and skills and it also
seeks to promote the excitement of learning and doing the different experiments
in science.</p>
