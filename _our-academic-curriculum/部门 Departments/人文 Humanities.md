<p><strong>DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Singaporean Issues Forum</strong>
</p>
<p>The Contemporary Singaporean Issues or CSI Forum is held annually for
Upper secondary students in NCHS to understand the interconnectedness of
Singapore and the world they live in. The forum aims to:</p>
<p>(i) raise students’ awareness of societal issues in a contemporary world,</p>
<p>(ii) motivate them to become concerned citizens who appreciate the complex
and</p>
<p>multifaceted nature of our challenges, and</p>
<p>(iii) challenge students to think critically so as to propose innovative
solutions to today’s problems.</p>
<p><strong>Humanities Talent Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Humanities Talent Programme seeks to identify students who display
keen interest and passion in Humanities. Through deeper studies of the
Humanities subjects – Geography, History and Literature, students learn
to better appreciate complex societal issues from a multi-disciplinary
perspective. Students in this programme will have many learning opportunities
to broaden their exposure in the Humanities.</p>
