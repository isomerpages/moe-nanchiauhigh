**1941**

南侨中学最初为民办的南侨师范学校，由华裔领袖、商人、慈善家陈嘉庚先生于1941年创办。当时，他的女婿李光前先生捐出金炎路的别墅和土地为校址，此事获得其他社会贤达热烈捐款支持，从而促成了南侨师范学校的成立。不料1941年日军挥师南下，这项办学计划搁浅，南侨师范学校成立不久被迫停办。在1941年12月底，日军节节逼近，华社仓促成立星华义勇军（Dalforce），并以金炎路校舍为总部，为抗击敌军和保卫新加坡写下了悲壮的历史。

Nan Chiau High School was founded as Nan Chiau Teachers’ Training School in 1941 by Chinese businessman, community leader and philanthropist Mr Tan Kah Kee. Its first campus was built on a plot of land donated by Lee Kong Chian, at Kim Yam Road in River Valley. In early 1942, the campus was used as the headquarters and training grounds for Dalforce, a Chinese volunteers’ army that was formed immediately before the overland attack of the Japanese army.

  

**1947**

南侨师范学校在1947年重开时，福建会馆将之改为南侨女子中学，另附设男女同校的小学，并委任杨振礼先生为首任校长。随后，女生宿舍于1950年年代设立。

In 1947 Nan Chiau Teachers’ Training School was converted by Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan into Nan Chiau Girls’ High School, with an ancillary primary school, with Mr Yang Zhen Li as the first Principal of the School. A female hostel was also built in the 1950s. 

  

**1965**

1965年，由于原有的校舍日渐老化，福建会馆斥资200万元重建南侨女中。中学部暂时迁至基里玛路临时校舍上课，小学部则留在拆迁中的原址上课。1969年，新校舍落成，并由时任教育部长的王邦文于3月8日主持开幕。

In 1965, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan spent $2 million rebuilding Nan Chiau Girl’s High School. During the construction, the high school section moved to temporary premises at Guillemard Road, while the primary school section remained at the original site. The new premises was declared open by Mr. Ong Pang Boon, Minister for Education, on 8 March 1969.

  

**1974**

1974年，中小学学生人数高达2692人，是南侨历史上学生人数最多的一年。当时中学部共有48个班级，而小学部则有24个班级。为了应付学生增多的需求，福建会馆于1976年再耗资30万元将校舍增至五层。

In 1974, there were a total student enrollment of 2692, the most number of students in the school’s history, with 48 secondary classes and 24 primary classes. To cope with the increased school population, another $300 000 was spent to add on a 5th storey to the school building.

  

**1984** 

人口外移，报读南侨的学生人数逐年减少。因形势所迫，南侨女中于1984年开始招收男生，校名改为“南侨中学”。

The residential area surrounding Kim Yam Road was becoming a mature estate and that contributed to a sharp decline in student enrolment. The school went to fully co-educational in 1984 to overcome the challenges. Nan Chiau Girls’ High School was then renamed to be Nan Chiau High School. 

  

**2000**

九十年代至千禧年，南侨中学收生率持续下滑，各种不利因素导致学校面临重重困难，学校发展饱受考验。面临可能闭校的危机，福建会馆必须做出艰难的抉择：是放弃金炎路校址并迁往盛港新镇继续办校；还是保留校址，关闭学校，另作他用。要保校或保地，让会馆、学校和校友们困扰不已。学校在这十年里饱受煎熬，路途更是崎岖坎坷。

2001年初，福建会馆毅然放弃金炎路校址，在华社领袖、校友会和社会善心人士的多方努力下，南侨中学落户盛港，分别开办中学和小学，为一个新时代掀开新的篇章。

The student population continued to shrink in the 1990s as a result of the changing demographics in the River Valley area. In spite of the school’s rich history and the ample support from the alumni and the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, the school was on the verge of permanent closure. As such, a decision had to be made either to repurpose the plot of land on Kim Yam Road and hence close the school or to exchange the land for a new campus in Sengkang new town. 

Though it was a challenge, the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, the school and our alumni unanimously decided to give up the valuable plot of land at Kim Yam Road to secure a future for Nan Chiau High School.

  

**2010**

2010年11月，时任教育部长的黄永宏医生在福建会馆“福建文化节”上致词时宣布，南侨中学将于2012年1月成为新加坡第十一所特选中学。随着部长的宣布，现场一片欢呼，掌声如雷贯耳。 在场的每一个人激动亢奋，相互拥抱握手道贺。这是历届会馆校董理事，师生，家长以及许许多多心系南侨的校友多年来的愿望。即将步入新时代的南侨中学，能够以特选学校的名义，更全面地弘扬华族文化与传统。

In November 2010, Nan Chiau High School was designated by the Ministry Of Education to become the 11th Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school from January 2012. The news was announced by then minister of education Dr Ng Eng Hen at the Hokkien Festival 2010. The news was welcomed by thousands of school alumni and educators, who felt pleased that the school can finally fulfill its mission of preserving the Chinese heritage and culture.

  

**2020** 

为了让南侨学生对母族文化与传统有更深一层的认识，南侨中学通过双文化旗舰课程，希望可以培养荟萃中西的双语双文化精英。2020年，南侨中学获选开办华文语文特选课程，旨在提升学生的华文语文水平、深化学生对中文文学的认识与鉴赏能力、培养能够洞悉未来、心系祖国的双语精英，希望学生更加热爱华文华语的学习。

The school continued to stay true to its roots in providing students with an education enriched with Chinese values and heritage and nurturing bicultural leaders, who are future-ready thinkers and caring citizens. In 2020, NCHS is selected by Ministry of Education to offer Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) that aims to:

*   Nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese.
    
*   Enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. 
    
*   Develop students to be effectively bilingual to better serve the needs of our nation.
