校徽

SCHOOL CREST

The crest is represented by three interlocking rings, which symbolizes the moral, physical and intellectual development of our pupils. These are intrinsic to the quest for excellence in education.

The red colour of the rings depicts a persevering spirit in the pursuit of a bright and promising future, as represented by the golden background.

The heart shape in the centre of the overlapping rings symbolizes care and concern for the total welfare of our pupils in a student-oriented system.
