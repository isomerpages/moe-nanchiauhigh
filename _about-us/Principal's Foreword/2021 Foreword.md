回顾学校七十四年来走过的风雨，从老校舍金炎路搬迁到盛港新镇，我们不忘感谢各界人士给予南侨中学如凤凰般浴火重生的机会与协助，让我们能够继续发扬陈嘉庚先生办学办校的优良精神。

  

**#ChooseToCelebrate #一路风华**

  

“目标高远，胸怀大志”，筹备多时的南侨中学语文特选课程课室“远志”于今年的三月八日的74周年校庆正式开幕，为修读语特的南侨学生提供专属学习空间。我们很荣幸邀请到本地著名书法家朱添寿为“远志”题字，以及本地非物质文化遗产项目华人手工牌匾雕刻大师杨昌泰先生与谢翰林先生亲手操刀，在一凿一削中结合书法和木刻艺术，为我们语特室生色不少。

  

In 2019, Nan Chiau High School was 1 of the 9 schools identified to implement the Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) starting from 2020. Last year, we welcomed our pioneer batch of 31 CLEP-Sec students, among whom, 16 were awarded the CLEP-Sec Scholarship. This year, we have just concluded the scholarship selection in March, and we have another 17 students who will be awarded the CLEP –Sec Scholarship. 南侨中学很幸运得到各界人士的鼎力支持。从去年开始，本地著名作家尤今老师已经给首两届的语特生办了创意写作班，让学生在掌握创作技巧和知识的同时，也学会徜徉在缤纷灿烂的文学世界里。电台100.3 DJ 张承尧也拨冗给孩子们授课学习制作广播节目，而今年我们也有幸请到本地资深导演邓宝翠来教授语特学生从电影看文学的特殊学习经历。我在这里分享其中一位学生，李绮欣的学习经验。 “作为第一届中学语特学生，我对语特活动充满了好奇和期待。一直到现在，我很庆幸自己加入了语特这个大家庭。我有幸参加了尤今老师的 “快乐写作班”，让我在欢声笑语中学习到写作的不同要素。同时我也上了陶瓷课，让我有机会发挥自己的创意，亲手设计和制作瓷砖，把文学元素通过不同的方式展现出来。另外，作为语特奖学金得主，除了获得奖学金，我还获得教育部津贴参加语特营和浸濡计划，这让我十分期待！”

  

As a SAP school, it is our prerogative to ensure all NCzens read Higher Chinese Language from Secondary 1 and to become effectively bilingual at the end of 4 years in Nan Chiau. I am proud to announce that most of our students are coping well with Higher Chinese Language. Last year, we had the largest cohort of O-level Higher Chinese Language candidates. The performance of our Sec 3 Higher Chinese Language students who took the year-end Chinese Language national examination has also steadily improved over the years and they performed exceptionally well in 2020. This Sec 3 HCL cohort had 100% of students attaining B3 and above, with 83.5% of students attaining distinction in the subject. We are deeply encouraged by their outstanding results and our students’ positive attitude in mastering their Chinese Language.

  

  

**#ChooseCourage #砥砺前行**

  

2019冠状病毒的肆虐影响了学校的正常运作，学生无法回到学校上课，老师们也非常担心学生们的学习进度，然而2020年南侨应届毕业生却秉持着陈嘉庚先生的诚毅精神，排除万难，在O水准会考中整体维持应有的高水准。实际上相较于前几届，这届有更多的考生考取优异的成绩，更令人鼓舞的是许多成绩优异的学生也是学生领袖，他们在面临前所未有的挑战时，不但能兼顾学校所赋予的领导任务，也能同时兼顾自己的学业，这真是所谓的文武双全！

  

During the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker in 2020, lessons were converted to home-based learning. Staff had a short runway to learn and prepare for the home-based learning lessons while students had to quickly adapt to the new learning environment. Especially for our graduating students, it was a situation that many had to take in their stride and to overcome the challenges of not being physically in school. Under such unforeseen circumstances, both staff and students **#ChoseCourage**. This is a testament of Nan Chiau students’ Power of ME, strong will and determination.

  

I am deeply heartened that many staff members have **#ChosenCourage** and explored alternatives so that the exposure and learning would not stop for our students. Last year, many school events and programmes were called off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While staff were not expected to carry out certain programmes under SMM, many tried conducting online ‘live’ lessons for the first time and many programmes took on a new format. For example, Vice Principal, some teachers and myself participated in a ‘live’ programme, “南侨中学，你在吃什么?” during the Circuit Breaker period to engage students who spent most of their time at home. Through this programme, we connected with our students and sent the message that we can overcome this difficult situation together as one. We wanted them to know that every single student and staff forms an integral part of the NCHS family. We also continued to support cluster schools and schools offering Literature in Chinese in the learning of Chinese literature and culture, by **#ChoosingCourage** and organising the first ever online Chinese literature talk as well as a book sharing session. We **#ChoseCourage** again and hosted an online professional development workshop for CL teachers in the N4 cluster at the end of last year.

  

Like our forefathers, we have **#ChosenCourage** in the eye of adversity and have accomplished much. We know that tough times don’t last, tough people do. “不经一番寒彻骨 哪得梅花扑鼻香”, we are hopeful that after the pandemic, we will emerge stronger.

  

  

**#ChooseHope #人文日新**

  

This year, NCHS’ Positive Education focuses on the ‘Power of Yet’ and the cultivation of growth mindset in our students. We believe in nurturing every NCzen and provide the space and opportunity for them to unleash their potential and see new possibilities. It is the attitude of “you can do it” and the cultivation of “hope” that our students’ continue to strive for success.

  

作为特选中学，南侨中学为学生提供一个修读高级华文的优良学习环境。承蒙各方合作伙伴的支持，南侨中学致力于开展有助于华文华语学习的众多活动，我们希望所有的耕耘终究能开花结果，让南侨中学成为东北区莘莘学子学习华文的首选学府，并在培养双语双文化人才方面继续扮演着举足轻重的角色。我们也希望南侨中学的学生，不论背景与起点，都会对自己的华文学习充满信心，坚持不懈，成为精通双语双文化的南侨毕业生。

  

今年二月七日是南侨中学校史上重要的里程碑。在新加坡福建会馆、南侨校友会、安达建设私人有限公司许仁美博士、新加坡科技设计大学杨茳善副教授，和许多专家们的鼎力支持下，我们将位于金炎路旧校址的一对旧校门石柱迁移到学校现址。在接下来的重置、修复期间，我们也将拍摄和记录许多珍贵的现场画面，让大家通过这些具有历史和教育意义的镜头，一起回忆南侨中学的历史。

  

在此，我们也衷心感谢金炎路社区居民多年来默默帮助我们监护着这对旧校门石柱。我们将把石柱完好无损地重置在学校现址。校门石柱与学校的大团圆不仅仅是南侨中学的心愿，身为特选中学的我们也想借此机会纪念和感谢华社先贤们为本地华教做出的巨大贡献。南侨中学学子必定饮水思源，薪火相传。
