**洞悉未来 ● 荟萃中西 ● 心系祖国**

**Future-Ready Thinkers ● Bicultural Leaders ● Caring Citizens**

  

南侨中学自去年初于特选学校庆祝成立40周年之际，就着手为学校的发展方向进行反思并创建新的愿景和发展策略。在迎接面向多元化教育景观的新时代，这个以“传承特选学校精神，共创崭新年代愿景”为主轴的全新版策略蓝图巩固了南侨中学肩负为新加坡培养双语双文化人才的使命。今年八月五日，经过全校师生一年半来的努力，我们终于为这个崭新的愿景、使命及价值观掀开序幕。学生领袖（FALCONS）及班级委员接着以陈嘉庚先生的生平事迹为参照，带领全校深入讨论对学校六大价值观的理解。同时，我们也将校史融入校本品格及公民教育课程，让师生深入了解创校先贤、历届校长、师生的贡献及期望。中三年级的同学更是齐心制作一系列的录像，以极具创意的方式重新演绎我校一路走来所经历的挑战，让全体师生对过去的南侨女中以及在旧校址的南侨中学有了深入的认识，加强了“爱我南侨”的归属感。放眼未来，我校期待南侨中学学子能秉持特选学校的优良精神扎根新加坡，并兼具国际视野和跨文化的交流能力与世界接轨，为新加坡发光发亮！

  

  

**凤栖安谷，守望二十**

**NanChiauHighSchool@Sengkang: From Our Hearts to Yours**

  

It is said that a joy shared is a joy multiplied. At the start of 2020, in alignment with the school’s theme of “Gratitude”, we shared our joy by launching the NanChiauHighSchool@Sengkang: From Our Hearts to Yours （凤栖安谷，守望二十）initiative to commemorate the school’s 20th year of residence in Sengkang. This was part of our school’s continued efforts to express our sincere gratitude for the strong support rendered by the community to NCHS in the last two decades. NCHS has grown from strength to strength since relocating to Anchorvale （安谷）, just like the mythical phoenix that rose from the ashes. As expressed in this year’s Chinese New Year couplets 《携手同心，二十年图强发奋兴盛港；和衷共济，一方水润物回春泽南侨》, our close partnership with the Sengkang community for the past 20 years has helped us to overcome multiple adversities.

  

We will fondly remember how we began our Chinese New Year celebration with a series of Values-in-Action activities co-planned by us and the Sengkang West Grassroots Organisations to serve the community. All NCzens were mobilised to visit the Residents’ Committees, shopping malls, coffee shops, kindergartens and Anchorvale Community Club to share the joy of the Chinese New Year festive season. We taught young children handicraft, sang Chinese New Year songs with elderly residents, and enjoyed Prosperity Toss (Lohei) with the cleaners in the estate. We also conveyed our heartfelt appreciation to the dedicated staff who continued to provide essential services at the Sengkang Community Hospital, Sengkang Fire Station, Sengkang Police Post and Sengkang MRT station and bus interchange throughout the festive season.

  

The saying “To rise like a phoenix from the ashes” means to emerge from a catastrophe stronger, smarter and more powerful. In our 20th year in Sengkang, NCHS continues to stand tall and confident. We continue to be a high-performing school, the choice school for many students and, more importantly, we are a school that the Sengkang community is proud of.

  

  

**洞悉未来 ● 成就梦想 ● 青春无悔**

**Make This Year 20/20**

  

This is the theme which our Secondary 4 students conceptualised and set as a common goal for all NCzens this year. Besides being the start of a new decade, 2020 can also be understood as 20 out of 20, inspiring NCzens to attain their fullest potential this year. Looking at the design of the logo, the second 20, which is mirrored, connects the zeros together, forming the Nan Chiau High School logo in the centre. The purpose of this was for all of us to treasure every shared experience we will have together and to live this year in the best way that we can.

  

And indeed, we did.

  

The COVID-19 pandemic was an unfamiliar threat which disrupted almost all the plans that we had mapped since last year, but despite this, we are grateful that we actually gained much more as we were driven to step up and step out of our comfort zone. When the Circuit Breaker first began on 3 April, we saw how digital transformation took place with the full roll-out of Home-Based Learning (HBL) in schools. Adjustments were put in place to ensure the continuity of education and NCHS leveraged on this opportunity to enable teachers and NCzens to embrace digital learning. Being agile and resourceful, the transition to our first virtual classrooms with integrated interactive tools was carried out in a matter of days.

  

We re-formatted our CCAs, anniversary celebration, annual track and field meet, and National Day celebration, but we did not compromise on their purposeful learning intent as we continued to have active school participation through live broadcasts and improvised activities within the guidelines of the Safe Management Measures. This year, we also held our graduation ceremony about 2 weeks later as compared to the previous years. This was not just because our Sec 4s would be dearly missed, so we wanted to keep them in school longer, but also because our Sec 4s had spent substantially much less time in school this year because of COVID-19.

  

We have been through challenging times, but we have emerged stronger together in solidarity.

  

  

**自强不息 ● 厚德载物**

**Relentlessly strive towards excellence. With great virtues shoulder great responsibilities.**

  

This global coronavirus pandemic has already had an enormous impact and will surely have profound consequences for many years to come. However, the pandemic has also revealed a vast sea of kindness and benevolence in our communities, both locally and around the world. It has led to countless acts of selfless heroism in hospitals and care homes. It has impelled many of us to use our greatest strengths to serve our greatest purposes, giving our lives a new and inspiring meaning.

  

新型冠状肺炎席卷全球，然而在这艰难的时刻，疫情也是好的教育素材，让我们在彷徨无奈中学会感恩生活，珍惜生命。为弱势群体伸出援手，给前线医护人员献上敬意和鼓励，更为劳苦功高的老师和非教职员送上一张张充满真挚谢意的问候卡；南侨学子无畏无情的冠病，在社区、校园的每一个角落播下满满正能量，加强彼此的韧性一起跨过眼前难关，体现了“诚以待人，毅以处事”的南侨精神，确实勇于担当重任。

  

我们家南侨中学种有很多树，有竹子、柳树、榕树、罗汉松树、木麻黄树，还有芒果树、红毛丹树，苍翠茂密。It takes ten years to nurture a tree, but a hundred years to educate a man; “十年树木，百年树人”，美化校园环境的用意一再提醒我们“立德树人”的教育初衷，南侨学子也就似树苗，需要爱护、灌溉，并在日后必定成为参天大树。

  

爱我南侨。
