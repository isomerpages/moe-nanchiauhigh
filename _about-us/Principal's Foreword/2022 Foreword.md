**诚毅立身，博学持正，石叻欣逢先驱者；**

**敬谦修业，敦行创新，南侨更有后起人。**

**渡海开蒙，兴邦浴火，砥砺前行七秩加五载；**

                            **与时并进，饮水思源，鲲鹏展翅千寻更九天。**

光阴荏苒，我们在冠病疫情肆虐之下捱过了将近三个学年。2021年南侨应届毕业生更是在这新常态下度过了两年的中学高年级生涯。我们昵称他们为“神奇宝贝”（Magic Babies），因为他们在逆境中自强不息，脱颖而出；因为他们在不同的领袖岗位上灵机应变，带领团队逆风前行；因为他们体现了南侨中学文武双全的特质，在会考中考取优异的表现，创下我校历年来最多考生考获9科特优和8科特优的辉煌记录。

Besides their outstanding overall results, this cohort’s stellar performance in both the English Language and Higher Chinese Language results has also been remarkable. Distinction rates increased by 10% for both languages, to a high of 56.5% for English Language and 41.1% for Higher Chinese Language. This was the first batch where we enacted changes to school-based policies on subject combination, in which most of them studied Literature either in English or Chinese, and anchored them on strong language foundations. It is our raison d'etre as a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school - to groom strong bilingual and bicultural students who are deeply rooted in the strong SAP school ethos, and this cohort’s performance has certainly encouraged us that our efforts have reap good harvests.

南侨中学今日的辉煌不是偶然。今年我们75岁了，在过去的75年，我们历经三“落”、三“起”，间中甚至还连年留驻最低谷长达30年。若没有福建会馆毅然斥资办校，甚至做出弃地保校的艰难抉择；若没有南侨师生团结一致，共赴万难的决心；若没有华社、校友、家长和各方的鼎立支持，当年的南侨女中、南侨中学难以逆境求存。宝贵的经历磨练了我们，也为我们后来的浴火重生后奠定了坚实的基础。

In the 1970s, our student population climbed to 2700 which was the highest in the school's history. Two-year pre-university classes were also offered to top students, producing outstanding GCE Advanced Level examination results yearly. The school campus had also been revamped to support our pre-university students’ learning needs. Unexpectedly, at our peak, came an announcement to cease pre-university classes due to the establishment of Junior Colleges. This was the first blow.

The second blow was dealt when Nan Chiau Girls’ High School was not selected for the final list of the 9 SAP schools, announced in November 1978. This was a hard pill to swallow, given our identity and needs as a Chinese-medium school. Subsequently, to meet the changing social and economic context, in 1980, the school adopted English Language as the main medium of instruction, a difficult transition that we had to navigate.

Third blow, the residential area surrounding Kim Yam Road was becoming a mature estate and that contributed to a sharp decline in student enrolment over the years. In 1984, the school had to become fully co-educational to increase enrolment. Nan Chiau Girls’ High School was then renamed to be Nan Chiau High School. However, the crisis of declining enrolment is far from over. In spite of the school’s rich history and the ample support from the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan and the Nan Chiau Alumni, the school was on the verge of permanent closure.

Our school’s progress and development despite these three “lows and blows” illustrate the importance of continually molding ourselves to meet challenges while we remain steadfast in values, succinctly articulated through our school’s motto, “Sincerity and Perseverance”.

搬迁到盛港之前的三十年，南侨连续经历了三落。搬到盛港，南侨中学十年磨剑，期间大力提高学生掌握双语的水平，让学生具有双文化的修养，同时也锐意提升学生的学业成绩，为晋升成为特选中学的不变目标跨前一大步。全校齐心协力，不懈努力，凭着过人的毅力与决心，最终不负众望，迎来了三起。

第一“起”：2010年11月，时任教育部长黄永宏医生在福建会馆“福建文化节”上致词时宣布，南侨中学将于2012年1月成为新加坡第十一所特选中学。随着部长的宣布，现场一片欢呼，掌声如雷贯耳。 在场的每一个人，包括时任会长蔡天宝先生，都激动亢奋，相互拥抱握手道贺。这是历届会馆校董理事，师生，家长以及许许多多心系南侨的校友多年的愿望，南侨中学终于能够以特选学校的名义，更全面地弘扬华族传统与文化。

第二“起”：2011年7月，时任教育部长王瑞杰为新加坡艺术师范学院主持开幕仪式时宣布，南侨中学将于2012年推出强化美术课程（Enhanced Art Programme，简称EAP）。这项宣布是教育部对南侨中学历年来在美术方面屡获佳绩的认可。今年除了是我们创校75周年庆以外，也是南侨中学成为特选中学和开办强化美术课程的十周年里程碑，意义非凡。

第三“起”：2019年5月，时任教育部长王乙康在教师大会上宣布，由2020年开始，教育部将在九所中学开办中学华文语文特选课程，旨在提升学生的华文语文水平、深化学生对华文文学的认识与鉴赏能力，以及培养能够洞悉未来，又心系祖国的双语精英。南侨中学有幸搭上第一班列车，为莘莘学子营造富有人文气息的学习氛围，又获得各方人士的支持，举办了一系列与文坛大师级人物合作的培训，开拓学生的视野，巩固他们的文化底蕴。去年74周年校庆，前会长陈精毅先生和教育部学校北区司长卢玉娇女士一同剪彩，为我们的语特室《远志》开幕。我们首届语特班的31位学生也以优异的成绩毕业了，今天他们当中有不少继续在初院修读高中语特或在理工学院修读华文相关的课程，日后必定成为推广华文与传承文化的新一代接班人。

This brings me to the 2021 NCHS cohort’s slogan of RElearn, REthink and REinvent. I find this slogan fitting, since these three “REs” are evident not only in the achievements of this cohort of magic babies, but also in our school’s 75-year history. I would like to go further to suggest that underpinning these three “REs” is a more important fourth one - Resilience. For it is this virtue that has allowed NCHS to soar beyond limitations and despite uncertainties.

Where does resilience fit into our school’s philosophy? It is central to our school’s Positive Education framework, in place since 2019. NCzens are familiar with the three “powers” - the power of ME, the power of Giving, and the Power of Yet. We have always believed in nurturing our students with a growth mindset and an ability to draw from their character strengths to emerge stronger amidst setbacks.

I would like to take this opportunity to share how the school hopes to give renewed focus to resilience and the Power of Yet. Since 2018, NCzens begin their day with Mindfulness Empowerment, or ME time as we call it more dearly, where they practice mindfulness empowerment through mindful breathing. We start the day right by checking in with ourselves, tuning in to our thoughts, emotions and intentions. Starting from 2020, the ME time audio track reminds us of the power of GIVING - gratitude for where we are, for being able to embark on another school day surrounded by those who care about us, for being able to bless others with our presence and support. In Term 3 this year, NCzens refreshed this ME time and recorded a new bilingual track that allows all 3 Powers of Positivity to take centrestage. NCHS will RElearn, REthink, REinvent and be Resilient in this new age of post-COVID times!

Lastly, I present to you NCHS’ favourite song, our 75th Anniversary Theme Song which is a collaboration between the Chinese Language Elective Programme Scholars, Higher Music students and NCHS Choir. This song《不变的事》 speaks of the unchanging strength of Nan Chiau staffs, students and partners over the past 75 years, and more importantly, it also enables us to endure and excel for more great years ahead.

世界改变了  我们的故事

但不变的是  我们的坚持

来许愿  未来会更好

我站在世界舞台闪耀

多年以后  我们都有小小成就

念念不忘的  老师和朋友

多想念  回到小时候

我爱母校  爱我南侨

百年树人

是一步一步  拾级而上

撑过下坡路  不负众望

诚毅

呷你作伴 过秋冬春夏

  
  

爱我南侨
